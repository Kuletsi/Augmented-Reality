# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
The IDE I used for editing the code was Visual Studio Code. I did the deliverable entirely on my laptop so I set up the locahost:8000 by following the instructions on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server"> How do you set up a local testing server? </a>.  I also downloaded GitHub Desktop but I didn't find it very useful, so I used the browser version. <br>
I linked the application in my respiratory at the lab. <br>
### The first Deliverable consisted of 3 tasks. <br>
The <b> first task </b> was adding two primitive shapes (a cylinder and a sphere). The code for the box was already given in the code so I copied and pasted it twice, and changed the "primitive: box;" to "primitive: sphere;" and primitive "primitive: cylinder;" accordingly. I also changed the ids. Then, I changed the colors of all three shapes (I found the hex codes online by googling "hex codes") and also their coordinates (their "position") so they wouldn't overlap. Lastly I arranged the height the width and the depth. (I made them quite big so the marker has to be a bit further away from the screen for all three to be visible).<br> <br>
The <b>second task</b> was adding snow to the scene. I found the code from A-frame school, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-particle-system-component" > Α-Frame particle system component</a> as it was given to us in the task description. I copy pasted the code, and made the snow baby pink (I also just googled it). I tried putting the a-entity both inside the a-marker and outside and found that outside works better, so I left it there. <br> <br> 
For the <b> third task</b>, at first I found the code from the link that was give to us ( <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-speech-command-component" > Α-Frame speech command component</a> ). I combined the examples that were given to us in the link and I also looked at the public examples that were linked in the discussions (<a href= "https://github.com/lmalave/aframe-speech-command-component/tree/master/examples"> Public examples of the speech command </a>). <br>


# 2nd Deliverable
The second deliverable consisted of 3 tasks. 
The first task was making a custom marker which when read displays an image and text. I made a square with my registry number written on it in photoshop and I uploaded it in <a href="https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html"> Custom marker generator </a>. Then I added it to my code and used one of the objects from the previous deliverable to test if it was working. It took some back and forth trying different fonts and sizes, but also bigger borders in the generator to get it to recognize my marker. After that I made the markers for Hydrogen and for Oxygen (since I was accustomed with the site) for later usage. After that I tried to insert my text (my name). At first I did it with another tag (I think I somehow did it with a-entity, but it was 3 weeks ago and I honestly don't remember) but then I found a-text and it behaved much better so I kept that. The text appeared flat when i first put it in, so I rotated it on the x axis. I did the same with the the image I chose. Later I also added a png image of a heart and I combined the three elements so they could all be visible (by editing their positions). Furthermore I changed the font of the a-text and the color. 
The second task was displaying 3D animations of the Hydrogen and the Oxygen atoms, by reading custom markers. I had made the markers previously. I made the 3D animations using blender and following a youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVBUzAnBcck&ab_channel=NEYOVA">. I added colors and letters, and also played a bit with the texture and animation, which I learned how to do from various sources, by googling my queries.
