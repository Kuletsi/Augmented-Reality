# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
The IDE I used for editing the code was Visual Studio Code. I did the deliverable entirely on my laptop so I set up the locahost:8000 by following the instructions on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server"> How do you set up a local testing server? </a>.  I also downloaded GitHub Desktop but I didn't find it very useful, so I used the browser version. <br>
I linked the application in my respiratory at the lab. <br>
### The first Deliverable consisted of 3 tasks. <br>
The <b> first task </b> was adding two primitive shapes (a cylinder and a shape). The code for the box was already given in the code so I copied and pasted it twice, and changed the "primitive: box;" to "primitive: sphere;" and primitive "primitive: cylinder;" accordingly. I also changed the ids. Then, I changed the colors of all three shapes (I found the hex codes online by googling "hex codes") and also their coordinates (their "position") so they wouldn't overlap. Lastly I arranged the height the width and the depth. (I made them quite big so the marker has to be a bit further away from the screen for all three to be visible).<br> <br>
The <b>second task</b> was adding snow to the scene. I found the code from A-frame school, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-particle-system-component" > Α-Frame particle system component</a> as it was given to us in the task description. I copy pasted the code, and made the snow baby pink (I also just googled it). I tried putting the a-entity both inside the a-marker and outside and found that outside works better, so I left it there. <br> <br> 
For the <b> third task</b>, at first I found the code from the link that was give to us ( <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aframe-speech-command-component" > Α-Frame speech command component</a> ). I combined the examples that were given to us in the link and I also looked at the public examples that were linked in the discussions (<a href= "https://github.com/lmalave/aframe-speech-command-component/tree/master/examples"> Public examples of the speech command </a>). <br>
